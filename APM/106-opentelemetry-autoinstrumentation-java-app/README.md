# 106-opentelemetry-autoinstrumentation-java-app

A simple Java application is launched with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) automatic instrumentation. The OpenTelemetry instrumentation is configured with multiple telemetry exporters. In parallel it is logging telemetry on the console, exporting to a local [jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io), and also exporting to the APM SaaS backend via the [APM OpenTelemetry collector container](https://hub.docker.com/r/aternity/apm-collector).

For this cookbook the [APM OpenTelemetry collector container](https://hub.docker.com/r/aternity/apm-collector) is configured to receive OTLP-gRPC but it also supports OTLP-http, jaeger and even zipkin telemetry.

## Prerequisites

1. an APM account (SaaS)
2. a Docker host, for example [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## Step by step

### Step 1 - Connect to APM web console

Navigate to APM (for example [https://apm.myaccount.aternity.com](https://apm.myaccount.aternity.com)) > Agents > Install Agents:

1. Find your **CustomerID**, for example *12341234-12341234-13241234*
2. Grab **SaaS Analysis Server Host**, for example *agents.apm.myaccount.aternity.com*

### Step 2 - Get the sources

Download the sources, for example [right-click here](https://github.com/riverbed/Riverbed-Community-Toolkit/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) to download the zip archive, and expand it locally.

Edit the [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) file if you want to manually configure the `SERVER_URL` environment variable of the APM OpenTelemetry Collector container, replacing *RIVERBED_APM_SAAS_SERVER_HOST* and *RIVERBED_APM_CUSTOMER_ID* with actual values. The remaining is set to pull the APM OpenTelemetry Collector container image from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/aternity/apm-collector) and expose the port 4317 to receive OTLP gRPC telemetry. It looks like this:

```yaml
services:
     
  riverbed-apm-opentelemetry-collector:

    image: registry.hub.docker.com/aternity/apm-collector:2022.4.0-4
    
    environment:
    
      SERVER_URL: "wss://${RIVERBED_APM_SAAS_SERVER_HOST}/?RPM_AGENT_CUSTOMER_ID=${RIVERBED_APM_CUSTOMER_ID}"
    
    ports:
    
      - "4317:4317/tcp"
```

The sources of the Java application consist in a single Java file [cookbook106.java](src/main/java/com/aternity/community/cookbook106/cookbook106.java), a standard Maven pom.xlm file, and a Dockerfile to build an image (packaging the app and injecting the OpenTelemetry instrumentation agent for Java [opentelemetry-javaagent.jar](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation)). The build will be done automatically when starting the containers with docker-compose in the next step. 

### Step 3 - Start the containers

In a shell, go to the Cookbook folder, configure the APM OpenTelemetry Collector using the environment variables, RIVERBED_APM_SAAS_SERVER_HOST and RIVERBED_APM_CUSTOMER_ID, and starts all the containers with docker-compose.

For example using Bash:

```bash
# Go to the directory that contains the cookbook
cd Riverbed-Community-Toolkit/APM/106-opentelemetry-autoinstrumentation-java-app

# Configure the environment variables for the APM OpenTelemetry Collector
export RIVERBED_APM_SAAS_SERVER_HOST="agents.apm.myaccount.aternity.com"
export RIVERBED_APM_CUSTOMER_ID="12341234-12341234-13241234"

# Start the containers
docker-compose up
```
or else using PowerShell:

```PowerShell
# Go to the directory that contains the cookbook
cd Riverbed-Community-Toolkit\APM\106-opentelemetry-autoinstrumentation-java-app

# Configure the environement variable for the APM OpenTelemetry Collector
$env:RIVERBED_APM_SAAS_SERVER_HOST="agents.apm.myaccount.aternity.com"
$env:RIVERBED_APM_CUSTOMER_ID="12341234-12341234-13241234"

# Start the containers
docker-compose up
```

### Step 4 - Open the APM web console to visualize and analyze the traces collected for every transaction

The app simply fetches a page from a url, parses the contents and exits. To generate telemetry continuously, the app container is defined in the [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) with *restart: always* so that the app will restart indifinitely.

In Aternity Web console, in the Search tab, the transactions will appear with the instance name "service106-java-otlp"

## Notes 

### Stop the app and all the containers

Press CTRL + C in the shell where it is running.

Or in a shell, go to the folder where you keep the [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) and run:

```shell
docker-compose down
```

### How to launch myapp.jar with automatic instrumentation and multiple exporters?

Here is a sample in Bash that shows how to run a java app (myapp.jar) with OpenTelemetry automatic instrumentation and multiple exporters: logging on the console, otlp-grpc and jaeger. In this example the jaeger and otlp-grpc OpenTelemetry endpoints are running on the localhost. OpenTelemetry exporters are configured using environment variables. The jar for the automatic instrumentation will be downloaded ([opentelemetry-javaagent.jar](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/releases/download/v1.12.1/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar)) and injected using the JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS environment variable.

```bash
# Configure OpenTelemetry instrumentation (OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER default is "OTLP")
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME="myapp"
OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=logging,otlp,jaeger

## OTLP-gRPC
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL="grpc"
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:4317"

## Jaeger
OTEL_EXPORTER_JAEGER_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:14250"

# Inject OpenTelemetry automatic instrumentation
curl -OL https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/releases/download/v1.12.1/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar
JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS="-javaagent:./opentelemetry-javaagent.jar"

# Run the app
java -jar myapp.jar
```
