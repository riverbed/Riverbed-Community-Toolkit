# 107-opentelemetry-autoinstrumentation-nodejs-app

In this cookbok, the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) automatic instrumentation is added to a simple **nodejs** webapp (based on Express). And [APM](https://www.riverbed.com/products/application-performance-monitoring) collects the OTLP telemetry with the [APM OpenTelemetry Collector container](https://hub.docker.com/r/aternity/apm-collector).

This cookbook differs from the [cookbook 104](../104-opentelemetry-zipkin-nodejs-app), where instrumentation is manual and exports Zipkin telemetry.

## Prerequisites

1. an APM account (SaaS)
2. a Docker host, for example [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## Step by Step

### Step 1. Get your CustomerID & SaaS Analysis Server Host details from the APM web console

Navigate to APM (for example [https://apm.myaccount.aternity.com](https://apm.myaccount.aternity.com)) > Agents > Install Agents:

1. Find your **CustomerID**, for example *12341234-12341234-13241234*
2. Grab **SaaS Analysis Server Host**, for example *agents.apm.myaccount.aternity.com*

Those information are required to activate the APM OpenTelemetry Collector container, passing via the environment variable `SERVER_URL`. 

### Step 2. Start the containers

Download a local copy of the  [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) file, for example in the directory `Tech-Community/107-opentelemetry-autoinstrumentation-nodejs-app`


Start the containers using the [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml), for example with Bash:

```bash
cd Riverbed-Community-Toolkit/APM/107-opentelemetry-autoinstrumentation-nodejs-app

# Configure the environment variables for the APM OpenTelemetry Collector
export RIVERBED_APM_SAAS_SERVER_HOST="agents.apm.myaccount.aternity.com"
export RIVERBED_APM_CUSTOMER_ID="12341234-12341234-13241234"

docker-compose up
```

or with PowerShell:

```PowerShell
cd Riverbed-Community-Toolkit/APM/107-opentelemetry-autoinstrumentation-nodejs-app

# Configure the environement variable for the APM OpenTelemetry Collector
$env:RIVERBED_APM_SAAS_SERVER_HOST="agents.apm.myaccount.aternity.com"
$env:RIVERBED_APM_CUSTOMER_ID="12341234-12341234-13241234"

docker-compose up
```

### Step 3. Use the app to generate some telemetry

The application should now be running. Every trace is collected by the APM OpenTelemetry Collector.

Navigate to http://localhost:8107/fetch from a browser or call the url from a command line. 

![service107-js](images/aternity-opentelemetry-service107-js-navigate.png)

For example using curl:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8107/fetch
```

### Step 4. Open the APM web console to visualize and analyze the traces collected for every transaction

Search transaction, browse the spans for the selected transaction :

## Notes 

### Stop the app and all the containers

Press CTRL + C in the shell where it is running.

Or in a shell, go to the folder where you keep the [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) and run:

```shell
docker-compose down
```

### More details

The cookbook contains few files:
- [app.js](app.js) is a simple web app that listens http request (using Express) and exposes a `/fetch` method. 
- [trace_app_with_opentelemetry.js](trace_app_with_opentelemetry.js) is a nodejs bootstrap to run the web app and enable the OpenTelemetry instrumentation
- [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) defines the docker image to build
- [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) is the main file that defines the multi-containers app with two services: the instrumented nodejs web app and the APM OpenTelemetry Collector 

In the [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml), on the APM OpenTelemetry Collector section, the image is set to be downloaded from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/aternity/apm-collector) and the port to receive Zipkin telemetry is open.

The only thing that needs to be configured is the `SERVER_URL` variable. It contains the Aternity CustomerID and SaaS Analysis Server Host that allow the container to connect to the Aternity SaaS service and get activated. The APM OpenTelemetry Collector section is simple:

```yaml
services:

  opentelemetry-collector:
    
    image: registry.hub.docker.com/aternity/apm-collector:2022.4.0-4
    
    container_name: riverbed-apm-opentelemetry-collector       
    
    environment:

      SERVER_URL: "wss://${RIVERBED_APM_SAAS_SERVER_HOST}/?RPM_AGENT_CUSTOMER_ID=${RIVERBED_APM_CUSTOMER_ID}"

    ports:
      - "4317:4317/tcp"
```

In the [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) above, the `SERVER_URL` has been defined by two *docker compose variables*, to ease external configuration (RIVERBED_APM_SAAS_SERVER_HOST and RIVERBED_APM_CUSTOMER_ID). It can also be hard-coded, like this this:

```yaml
      SERVER_URL: "wss://agents.apm.myaccount.aternity.com/?RPM_AGENT_CUSTOMER_ID=12341234-12341234-13241234"
```

On the application container side, the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable  is used to bind the web app telemetry exporter to the collector container:

```yaml
  service107_js:   
    
    environment:  
    
      OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT: http://riverbed-apm-opentelemetry-collector:4317
      OTEL_SERVICE_NAME: service107_js
```
