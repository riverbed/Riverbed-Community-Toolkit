# 105-opentelemetry-go-app

The [APM OpenTelemetry Collector](https://hub.docker.com/r/aternity/apm-collector) is part of the [Riverbed Platform](https://www.riverbed.com/platform) and can collect OTLP, the OpenTelemetry native telemetry protocols, as well as Jaeger and Zipkin telemetry.

In this cookbook, the APM collects the telemetry of a **Go** webapp that is instrumented using the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) SDK. It can export OpenTelemetry, [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/), or [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/) telemetry. The [APM OpenTelemetry Collector](https://hub.docker.com/r/aternity/apm-collector) container is deployed next to the web app. It collects every trace - no sampling.

## Prerequisites

1. an APM account (SaaS)
2. a Docker host, for example [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## Step by Step

### 1. Get your CustomerID & SaaS Analysis Server Host details from the APM web console

Navigate to APM (for example [https://apm.myaccount.aternity.com](https://apm.myaccount.aternity.com)) > Agents > Install Agents:

1. Find your **CustomerID**, for example *12341234-12341234-13241234*
2. Grab **SaaS Analysis Server Host**, for example *agents.apm.myaccount.aternity.com*

This information are required to activate the APM OpenTelemetry Collector container, passing via the environment variable `SERVER_URL`. 

### 2. Start the containers

1. Clone this repository.

2. Start the containers using the [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml), for example with Bash:
    ```bash
    cd Riverbed-Community-Toolkit/APM/105-opentelemetry-go-app

    # Configure the environment variables for the APM OpenTelemetry Collector
    export ATERNITY_SAAS_SERVER_HOST="agents.apm.myaccount.aternity.com"
    export ATERNITY_CUSTOMER_ID="12341234-12341234-13241234"

    docker-compose up
    ```

    or with PowerShell:

    ```PowerShell
    cd Riverbed-Community-Toolkit/APM/105-opentelemetry-go-app
    
    # Configure the environement variable for the APM OpenTelemetry Collector
    $env:ATERNITY_SAAS_SERVER_HOST="agents.apm.myaccount.aternity.com"
    $env:ATERNITY_CUSTOMER_ID="12341234-12341234-13241234"
    
    docker-compose up
    ```

### 3. Use the app to generate some telemetry (optional)

There is an in-built load generator in the `docker-compose` startup. If you want to manually add traffic, http://localhost:8081/ from a browser or call the url from a command line.
```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/
```

### 4. Open the APM web console to visualize and analyze the traces collected for every transaction

Search transaction, browse the spans for the selected transaction :

View details of a specific transaction as a waterfall chart :

## Notes 

### Stop the app and all the containers

Press CTRL + C in the shell where it is running.

Or in a shell, go to the folder where you keep the [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) and run:

```shell
docker-compose down
```

### More details

The cookbook contains few files:
- [main.go](cmd/opentelemetry-go-example/main.go) is the common start to the 2 distributed services - `frontend` & `backend`. 
- [tracer.go](internal/tracer/tracer.go) is the OpenTelemetry SDK setup for multiple exporters (OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Zipkin, file), and the [B3 context propagation](https://github.com/openzipkin/b3-propagation).
- [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) defines the docker image to build
- [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) is the main file that defines the multi-tier app with 4 services:
  - the instrumented 2-tier Go `frontend` web app 
  - the instrumented 2-tier Go `backend` web app
  - the APM OpenTelemetry Collector
  - the load generator
    
### Kubernetes

This example can also be executed on a K8s cluster.

Steps:
```shell
% <edit kubernetes/aternity-collector.yml
   with your Aternity SaaS Analysis Server host & customer id>
% kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
```
