# 203-instrument-java-app-with-apm-agent-in-container

In this cookbook, the full APM agent is installed inside the container image of the application, which is a Java web application based on [Java Spring Boot framework](https://spring.io/). The APM observability features allow to monitor the instance and profile every transaction.

## Prerequisites

1. a SaaS account for [APM](https://www.riverbed.com/products/application-performance-monitoring)
2. a Docker host, for example [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## Step 1. Get installation details in APM web console

In the APM webconsole, navigate to CONFIGURE > AGENTS > Install Agents to see the Agent Installation Steps section.

1. Find your **Customer Id**, for example *12341234-12341234-13241234*
2. Find the **SaaS Analysis Server Host**, for example *agents.apm.my_environment.aternity.com*
3. Download the latest **APM agent for Linux** package (also available on [Riverbed support](https://support.riverbed.com/content/support/software/aternity-dem/aternity-apm.html)), *appinternals_agent_latest_linux.gz*

Then in CONFIGURE > AGENTS > Configurations, 

4. Define a configuration for the app and download the .json file. For example create a new configuration and name it "configuration", configure Data Collection Settings to enable End-User Experience Data collection, Save and Download the file configuration.json

## Step 2. Cookbook preparation

1. Download the cookbook. For example download the [zip of the repository](https://github.com/riverbed/Riverbed-Community-Toolkit/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), expand it and go the folder Tech-Community/203-instrument-java-app-with-apm-agent-in-container
2. Copy the agent package appinternals_agent_latest_linux.gz in the subfolder apm-customization.
3. Copy the configuration file (prepared in Step 1.) to the subfolder apm-customization/config.
   
> :warning: if the name of the configuration file is not configuration.json then edit the initial-mapping to adapt the startup autoinstrumentation mapping 

## Step 3. Start the containers

Start the containers using docker-compose, for example with Bash:

```bash
cd Riverbed-Community-Toolkit/APM/203-instrument-java-app-with-apm-agent-in-container

# Configure the environment variables with the SAAS Account details
export RIVERBED_APM_SAAS_SERVER_HOST="agents.apm.myaccount.aternity.com"
export RIVERBED_APM_CUSTOMER_ID="12341234-12341234-13241234"

docker-compose up
```

or with PowerShell:

```PowerShell
cd Riverbed-Community-Toolkit/APM/203-instrument-java-app-with-apm-agent-in-container

# Configure the environment variables with the SAAS Account details
$env:RIVERBED_APM_SAAS_SERVER_HOST="agents.apm.myaccount.aternity.com"
$env:RIVERBED_APM_CUSTOMER_ID="12341234-12341234-13241234"

docker-compose up
```

## Step 4. Browse the app

The web application should now be available on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

Open the url in your browser and refresh the page few times to generate some traffic.

## Step 5. APM web console 

Go to the APM webconsole to monitor the instance and observe every transaction.
