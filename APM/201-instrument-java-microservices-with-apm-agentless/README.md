# 201-instrument-java-microservices-with-apm-agentless

This cookbook shows how to setup APM agentless for Java (the APM Java agent library for Linux) with auto-instrumentation on a Java app.

The demo app is the famous Java Community application called [Spring PetClinic Microservices](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-microservices), same app used in the [Cookbook 102: OpenTelemetry quickstart](../102-opentelemetry-spring-demo-app). The app is composed of multiple services that run in containers, like Config, Discovery Server, Customers, Vets, Visits and API.

Here, the [APM](https://www.riverbed.com/products/application-performance-monitoring) agent is injected in each service, enabling automatic instrumentation and performance monitoring.

## Prerequisites

1. an APM account (SaaS)
2. a Docker host, for example [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## Step by Step

### Step 1: Connect to the APM webconsole

Navigate to the APM webconsole url (for example [https://apm.myaccount.aternity.com](https://apm.myaccount.aternity.com)) > AGENTS > Install Agents:

1. Find your **CustomerID**, for example *12341234-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc*
2. Grab **SaaS Analysis Server Host**, for example *agents.apm.myaccount.aternity.com*
3. Obtain the **psockets host name** replacing *agents* with *psockets*, for example *psockets.apm.myaccount.aternity.com*
4. Download the package **APM Agentless Instrumentation (Java)** (also available on [Riverbed support](https://support.riverbed.com/content/support/software/aternity-dem/aternity-apm.html), for example *aternity-apm-jida-linux-12.19.0_BL516*

### Step 2: Get the docker-compose

Download a local copy of the file [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml), for example  [right-click here to download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riverbed/Riverbed-Community-Toolkit/refs/heads/master/APM/201-instrument-java-microservices-with-apm-agentless/docker-compose.yml) and save it in the directory `Tech-Community/201-instrument-java-microservices-with-apm-agentless`

In the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml), for each service, the auto-instrumentation configuration consists in few environment variables set with CustomerID and SaaS Analysis Server Host psockets endpoint, and a volume that mounts the agent.

```yaml
  cool-java-service:
    image: myapp/cool-java-service
    entrypoint: ["java", "-jar", "MyCoolService.jar"]
    environment:
      - JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-agentpath:/agent/lib/libAwProfile64.so
      - RVBD_ANALYSIS_SERVER=${RIVERBED_APM_SAAS_SERVER_HOST}
      - RVBD_CUSTOMER_ID=${RIVERBED_APM_CUSTOMER_ID}
      - RVBD_AGENT_FILES=1
      - RVBD_APP_INSTANCE=cool-java-service
    volumes:
      - ./agent:/agent
```

The CustomerID and SaaS Analysis Server Host can be defined manually, replacing RIVERBED_APM_SAAS_SERVER_HOST and RIVERBED_APM_CUSTOMER_ID directly in the file like this:

```yaml
  cool-java-service:
    image: myapp/cool-java-service
    entrypoint: ["java", "-jar", "MyCoolService.jar"]
    environment:
      - JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-agentpath:/agent/lib/libAwProfile64.so
      - RVBD_ANALYSIS_SERVER=psockets.apm.myaccount.aternity.com
      - RVBD_CUSTOMER_ID=12345678-abcd-1234-abcd-123456789012
      - RVBD_AGENT_FILES=1
      - RVBD_APP_INSTANCE=cool-java-service
    volumes:
      - ./agent:/agent
```


### Step 3: Start the containers

Open a shell

Go in the folder where you keep the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file you just configured. For example:

```shell
cd Riverbed-Community-Toolkit/APM/201-instrument-java-microservices-with-apm-agentless
```

Unzip the zip archive of the APM Java Agent package, it will be expanded in a subdirectory */agent*

```shell
unzip aternity-apm-jida-linux-xx.x.x_BLxxx.zip
```

Start the containers:

```shell
docker-compose up
```

### Step 4: Exercise the application

Browse http://localhost:8080 and click around to generate load and transactions that will be monitored by APM

### Step 5: Open the APM webconsole to visualize and analyze the traces collected for every transaction

View the entire applications:

![APM Application View](images/aternity-apm-spring-petclinic-application-view.png)

Search transactions:

![APM Transactions](images/aternity-apm-spring-petclinic-transactions.png)

View transaction details:

## Notes 

### Stop the app and all the containers

Press CTRL + C in the shell where it is running.

Or in a shell, go to the folder where you keep the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) and run:

```shell
docker-compose down
```
