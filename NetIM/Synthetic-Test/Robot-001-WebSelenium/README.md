# Web Selenium ROBOT Cookbook

This Web Selenium robot can play Synthetic Test in a web browser in the same conditions as real users.

Capabilities summary:

- Windows machine
- Synthetic Test in a web-browser in Edge or Chrome (Selenium automation with Python scripts)

The next paragraph explains how to setup from scratch on a Windows machine. It include the installation of Riverbed NetIM agent.

## Prerequisites

- a fresh machine with Windows 11 x64 and a user account with Administrator permissions
- a [Riverbed NetIM](https://www.riverbed.com/products/steelcentral/infrastructure-management.html) instance for Synthetic Test orchestration
- connectivity between the Windows machine and the NetIM Core node

## Preparation

### 1. Basic components

1. Download the [Riverbed Community Toolkit](https://github.com/riverbed/Riverbed-Community-Toolkit/archive/master.zip). Extract it on the C: drive and rename the folder "Riverbed-Community-Toolit" (removing the "-master" at the end)

2. Download and install a decent code editor, for example [Visual Studio Code - x64 System Installer](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads)

3. Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org). For example [Python 3.12.0 x64](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
> - Check the installer option to Add Python to PATH
> - Hit Custom Install button and in the Advanced Install options check to box to select"Install Python for all users"

4. Install **selenium 4** libraries for Python with pip (check [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) for details, the latest version is 4.15.2 as of nov. 2023). Open a Windows PowerShell (Admin) and run the following command:

```PowerShell
pip install selenium
```

### 2. Edge specific

1. Launch Edge and open the url [edge://settings/help](edge://settings/help) to check the version that is running (if not already there, fetch and install from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge)). 

For example Version 119.0.2151.72 (Official build) (64-bit).

2. Download the corresponding [MS Edge WebDriver](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/#downloads) for **Windows 64 bits** and extract it to c:\. 

After extraction the driver should be in the following path: C:\edgedriver_win64\msedgedriver.exe

### 3. Chrome specific

1. Download and install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

2. Launch Chrome and open the url [chrome://settings/help](chrome://settings/help) to check the version number

3. Download the corresponding [Chrome WebDriver](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/) matching the version for **Windows 64 bits** and extract it to c:\. 

After extraction the driver should be in the path: C:\chromedriver-win64\chromedriver.exe

### 4. NetIM agent

1. Download the NetIM TestEngine Agent installer from the **NetIM Core node**

The installer package can be found on the **NetIM Core node** in the directory /data1/riverbed/NetIM/**{{version}}**/external/TestEngine (replacing {{version}} to match your environment) or /data1/riverbed/NetIM/**latest**/external/TestEngine.

The folder contains the package for Linux and Windows (TestEngine-windows.zip, TestEngine-linux.zip). With your favorite SFTP tool, grab the zip file for Windows or use scp from the shell.

For example:

```PowerShell
scp netim_admin_username@netim_servername:/data1/riverbed/NetIM/latest/external/TestEngine/TestEngine-*.zip .
```

2. Install the NetIM TestEngine Agent

On your Windows machine, **extract TestEngine-windows.zip on C:**

Run the **install.bat** in a PowerShell (with Administrator privilege).
